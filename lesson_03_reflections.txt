When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Whenever it is more than one contributers to the same repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You don't want anything to happen with your files while you are working on then.
- Pull changes when you are ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork: When you make a clone of a repository on GitHub.
  - Use when you want to modify/start off with a repository you don't control
- Clone: When you copy a repository either outside or form GitHub to an other computer
  - Use when you want to work with a repository an other place than where it currently are
- Branch: When you create/follow a different commit path than the master path
  - Use when you implement a new feature and want to keep the master clean of experiments.
