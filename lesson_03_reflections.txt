When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Whenever it is more than one contributers to the same repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You don't want anything to happen with your files while you are working on then.
- Pull changes when you are ready
